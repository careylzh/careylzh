This is Carey, an aspiring software engineer based in Singapore. Here is one of my favourite programming memes:

Most of my repos are illustrations of a particular stack. Do note that stacks evolve - some portions of a stack may become deprecated. I've tried my best to maintain the code bases for relevancy. If you see something amiss/ambiguous, feel free to comment on any of the projects, or reach out to me through email.

There are also hardware hobby projects I do outside of work. 

Also, here are some resources I find useful:
