### <WIP> 
Heya 👋 this is Carey, an aspiring software engineer based in Singapore. I've come to realise that posting my github stats was cool, but not really helpful to aspiring software engineers.

Most of my repos are illustrations of a particular stack. Do note that stacks evolve, some become deprecated. I've tried my best to maintain the code bases for relevancy. Feel free to comment on any of the projects if you see something amiss/ambiguous, or reach out to me through email to provide feedback.

- 🛠️ Currently working on: TODO backlog in the current repos
- 🌱 Currently learning: how to develop and deploy a stack to production fast 
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on: hackathons! Any hackathon. Participated in one with strangers for the first time in June 2021.
- 🤔 Looking for help with: optimising my learning
-  ⚡  Recently Learned: You can squash commits in this hidden README.md
