### Heya 👋 
This is Carey. I used to do lots of small, non-prod hardware projects, then moved on to exploring web technologies, and the underlying idioms that make a language, library or framework unique. 

If you see something amiss/ambiguous in my projects, feel free to comment or reach out to me through email.

Also, here are some resources I find useful: <br />
