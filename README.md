### Heya 👋 
This is Carey, an aspiring software engineer based in Singapore. I used to do lots of hardware projects as a hobby, then moved on to exploring web technologies and understand the idioms that make the library or framework unique. 

If you see something amiss/ambiguous in my projects, feel free to comment or reach out to me through email.

Also, here are some resources I find useful: <br />
